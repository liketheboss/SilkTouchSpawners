# SilkTouchSpawners

### Goals
* This project is mainly to get me involved in increasingly complex Minecraft Plugins.
* This is like the _SilkSpawners_ plugin without need for EssentialsX to place spawners.

### Features
* Mine spawners with Silk Touch Pickaxe to pick up spawner
  * Stack spawners of same type
* Use commands to alter spawners

### Commands

* **/changespawner [entity-type]**
  * Allows user to change held spawner's type
